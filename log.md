# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Basic UI, worked on core functionality/logic, deployed the app.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling a bit with Material UI but I'll work on the style and responsiveness once I'm done with all the functionality. This wasn't too hard to do, I'm proud of how much progress I made in a day!
