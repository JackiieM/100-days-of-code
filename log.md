# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Basic UI, worked on core functionality/logic, deployed the app.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling a bit with Material UI but I'll work on the style and responsiveness once I'm done with all the functionality. This wasn't too hard to do, I'm proud of how much progress I made in a day!

### Day 2: February 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: - Created a JSON file with different item prices for my Chipotle'd project. Completed 7 lessons of the Intermediate algorithm scripting unit in  the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The freecodecamp questions are getting harder!! and I've learned that taking breaks helps me more than to try and force myself to study for crazy long hours.
